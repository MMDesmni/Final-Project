# Final-Project
In this code we have two data set about Portuguese students performance in math and portuguese
In this code we first clean the data and weork with the NaN values and after that we extract the data
After that we have our plots by using the matplotlib and seaborn library 
After that we use the pairplot method so we could fine any possible relations between diffrent features
And at last we give statistic report of the data set we were analysing and give our final report.
